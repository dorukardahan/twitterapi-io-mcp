Is it X or Twitter? ▼ X is the new name for Twitter (rebranded in 2023). It's the same platform; we say 'X (formerly Twitter)' so developers who still search for 'Twitter API' can find us. How do I use TwitterAPI.io? ▼ Simply create a free account, copy your API key, and start calling our REST or WebSocket endpoints. Swagger docs, a Postman collection, and ready-to-paste code snippets make integration painless. Do I need a Twitter developer account? ▼ No! TwitterAPI.io bypasses the need for Twitter's approval process. Start immediately with just an API key. How does pricing work? ▼ Simple pay-as-you-go: $0.15 per 1,000 tweets, $0.18 per 1,000 profiles. No monthly fees, no hidden costs. What's your rate limit? ▼ We support 1000+ requests per second by default. Need more? Contact us for custom enterprise limits. How fresh is your data? ▼ Real-time. Our data is updated continuously with sub-second latency from Twitter's firehose. Can I try it risk-free? ▼ Get $0.1 in free credits immediately - no credit card required to start. What about support? ▼ 24/7 live chat support, comprehensive docs, and dedicated account managers for enterprise customers. Do you offer academic discounts for students and researchers? ▼ Yes! We're committed to supporting education and academic research. We offer special academic pricing for students, faculty, and research institutions.
