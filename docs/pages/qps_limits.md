Loading... QPS Limits Free User Limitations For free users, you can only get very low QPS. You can only make one API request every 5 seconds. Please recharge to become a paid user to solve QPS limitations and unlock higher request rates.

QPS (Queries Per Second) limits determine the maximum number of API requests you can make per second. These limits are based on your account balance to ensure fair usage and optimal performance for all users.

As your account balance increases, so does your QPS limit, allowing for higher throughput and more concurrent requests.

Enterprise-grade public data API that powers your decision-making with real-time social intelligence.

We donate a portion of every sale to fund carbon removal technologies.
