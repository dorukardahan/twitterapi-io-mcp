After you configure the settings, the system needs 20 minutes to complete the automatic setup. We will optimize this process later to make it faster (future: 5 minutes).

Additional Account Pricing If you subscribe to the $149 plan, it covers monitoring for 50 accounts. If you have been monitoring 150 accounts and delete one then add a new one—this is still supported. However, an additional one-time fee of $1 per new account will be charged.
