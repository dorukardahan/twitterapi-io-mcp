Let's get straight to the point. The official X API pricing is a major barrier. A quick look at their plans reveals just how expensive it is to get meaningful data access.

As the image highlights, the official Basic plan costs $200/month for a meager 15,000 tweets. Need more? The Pro plan skyrockets to $5,000/month for 1 million tweets. For most projects, this is simply unsustainable.

Now, compare this to TwitterAPI.io's pay-as-you-go model at just $0.00015 per tweet . Let's break down the math:
