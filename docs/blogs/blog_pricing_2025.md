Cost Comparison: X Pro vs. TwitterAPI.io Let's see what $5,000 gets you. The difference is staggering and highlights the massive savings you can achieve.

In simple terms, for every $100 you would spend on the official X Pro plan for tweet reads, you would only spend about $3 with TwitterAPI.io to get the same amount of data.
